# File Automator
The reason I wrote this program is I was sick of having to zip files that i was not using much but wanted to keep them and save disk storage.
## Purpose
The purpose of this is to transverse through my computer and based on certain extension criterias to zip those files and remove the raw ones.

### Usage
To use the project compile using:
```
clean.py [directory] [jsonfile]
```

Meaning of the Parameters:
```
directory - where the sweep will be done
jsonfile - the file used for all the config look at the github example for the jsonfile format
```

### TODO
- Add cleaning downloads folder opton
- centralize where all the zip files go (possibly)
- find more ideas for it
